# Style Changer On Button Click
StyleChangerOnButtonClick is a JavaScript script that adds functionality to your web page by allowing the styles of a specified element to be dynamically changed when a button is clicked.

This script uses the `click` event on a button with id `changeStyle`. On each click, it accesses the element with id `styledElement` and changes its styles. In this case, the text color is set to `'red'`, the font size is set to 20 pixels, and a 2 pixel thick border is added, `'2px solid blue'`.

This script provides the ability to dynamically change the styles of an element on your web page, which can be useful when creating interfaces with the ability to personalize the appearance of elements through user interaction.
